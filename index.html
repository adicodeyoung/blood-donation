<h1>Blood donation requirements</h1>
<p>
    Who can donate blood?
    Healthy adults (18-75 years) who meet donation eligibility criteria can donate blood. The procedure is safe and relatively painless.
    
    During a regular donation, you will give around 470ml of whole blood. This is about 8% of the average adult’s blood volume.
    
    The body replaces this volume within 24 to 48 hours, and replenishes red blood cells in 10 to 12 weeks.

To donate blood, Lifeblood donors must:

Be healthy and not suffering from a cold, flu or other illness at the time of donation.
Be aged between 18 and 75 years (other rules may apply if you are a current donor).
Weigh at least 50kg.
Have normal temperature and blood pressure.
Additional screening measures are in place due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Meet guidelines designed to protect both the donor and the people who will receive the blood.
Some medications may affect your ability to donate blood. To find out if your medication rules you in or out, call Lifeblood on 13 14 95.
</p>

<h1>How often can you donate blood?</h1>
<p>
    You can donate whole blood every 12 weeks, but you can donate plasma every 2 weeks.
</p>

<h1>Types of blood donation</h1>
<p>
    Blood – a standard donation, consisting of plasma, red and white blood cells, platelets, antibodies and other components.
Plasma (known as apheresis) – plasma is separated from the other components by a special machine, and the red blood cells are returned to the donor in cycles throughout the donation.
Platelets (known as plateletpheresis) – done in a similar way to plasma donation, but the red cells and plasma are returned to the donor.
Less common donations include:

Autologous – prior to a scheduled operation or transfusion, a person donates blood for their own use.
Directed or designated donation – a donor can give blood that will be used for a specific person.
Autologous and directed donations are now rare, occurring only in special medical cases. These blood donations have the same risks as regular blood donations.

            Safe blood saves lives
This year, World Blood Donor Day will once again be celebrated around the world on 14 June. The event serves to thank voluntary, unpaid blood donors for their life-saving gifts of blood and also to raise awareness of the need for regular blood donations to ensure that all individuals and communities have access to affordable and timely supplies of safe and quality-assured blood and blood products, as an integral part of universal health coverage and a key component of effective health systems.


        </p>
        <h1> Focus of this year’s campaign</h1>
        <p> The campaign theme for this year’s World Blood Donor Day is “Safe blood saves lives” with the slogan “Give blood and make the world a healthier place”. The idea is to focus on the contribution an individual giver can make to improve health for others in the community. Blood donations are needed all over the world to ensure individuals and communities have access to safe and quality-assured blood and blood products in both normal and emergency situations. Through the campaign, we call on more people all over the world to become life-savers by volunteering to donate blood regularly.

            The objectives of this year’s campaign are:
            
            to celebrate and thank individuals who donate blood and to encourage those who have not yet donated blood to start donating;
            to highlight the need for committed, year-round blood donation, to maintain adequate supplies and achieve universal and timely access to safe blood transfusion;
            to focus attention on the contribution donors make to the entire community as a critical factor in improving health;
            to demonstrate the need for universal access to safe blood transfusion and provide advocacy on its role in the provision of effective health care and in achieving the goal of universal health coverage;
            to mobilize support at national, regional and global levels among governments and development partners to invest in, strengthen and sustain national blood programmes.
            </p>
            <h1>Health Services Blood Drive</h1>
            <p> We know the health sector has been feeling the pressure over the last two years taking on extra responsibilities, working longer hours, and putting a lot of energy and love into keeping people safe. And, through all of that, you’ve still been giving blood to save lives – it’s inspiring.

                You deserve a break; a chance to take a seat, put your feet up, and savour a nice cup of tea (or milkshake if you prefer!).
                
                And now’s the perfect time to do it. Not only is it long overdue, but once again Lifeblood Teams, made up of people like you, are joining forces in the Health Services Blood Drive and working towards a single goal of 10,700 donations</p>
                <h1>How much blood do you give when you donate?</h1>
                <p> 470ml. It's about 8% of the average adult's blood volume. Within 24-48 hours of donating, your body will have fully restored your blood volume.</p>

        <h1>What is blood?</h1>
        <p>Blood is a body fluid in the circulatory system of humans and other vertebrates that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells. Blood is composed of blood cells suspended in blood plasma.
            Your blood is made up of liquid and solids. The liquid part, called plasma, is made of water, salts, and protein. Over half of your blood is plasma. The solid part of your blood contains red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
        </p>

<h1>Blood contions to be wary of when donating</h1>
<p> 
    Hemorrhage (bleeding): Blood leaking out of blood vessels may be obvious, as from a wound penetrating the skin. Internal bleeding (such as into the intestines, or after a car accident) may not be immediately apparent.
    Hematoma: A collection of blood inside the body tissues. Internal bleeding often causes a hematoma.
    Leukemia: A form of blood cancer, in which white blood cells multiply abnormally and circulate through the blood. The abnormal white blood cells make getting sick from infections easier than normal.
    Multiple myeloma: A form of blood cancer of plasma cells similar to leukemia. Anemia, kidney failure and high blood calcium levels are common in multiple myeloma.
    Lymphoma: A form of blood cancer, in which white blood cells multiply abnormally inside lymph nodes and other tissues. The enlarging tissues, and disruption of blood's functions, can eventually cause organ failure.
    Anemia: An abnormally low number of red blood cells in the blood. Fatigue and breathlessness can result, although anemia often causes no noticeable symptoms.
    Hemolytic anemia: Anemia caused by rapid bursting of large numbers of red blood cells (hemolysis). An immune system malfunction is one cause.
    Hemochromatosis: A disorder causing excessive levels of iron in the blood. The iron deposits in the liver, pancreas and other organs, causing liver problems and diabetes.
    Sickle cell disease: A genetic condition in which red blood cells periodically lose their proper shape (appearing like sickles, rather than discs). The deformed blood cells deposit in tissues, causing pain and organ damage.
    Bacteremia: Bacterial infection of the blood. Blood infections are serious, and often require hospitalization and continuous antibiotic infusion into the veins.
    Malaria: Infection of red blood cells by Plasmodium, a parasite transmitted by mosquitos. Malaria causes episodic fevers, chills, and potentially organ damage.
    Thrombocytopenia: Abnormally low numbers of platelets in the blood. Severe thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding.
    Leukopenia: Abnormally low numbers of white blood cells in the blood. Leukopenia can result in difficulty fighting infections.
    Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): An uncontrolled process of simultaneous bleeding and clotting in very small blood vessels. DIC usually results from severe infections or cancer.
    Hemophilia: An inherited (genetic) deficiency of certain blood clotting proteins. Frequent or uncontrolled bleeding can result from hemophilia.
    Hypercoaguable state: Numerous conditions can result in the blood being prone to clotting. A heart attack, stroke, or blood clots in the legs or lungs can result.
    Polycythemia: Abnormally high numbers of red blood cells in the blood. Polycythemia can result from low blood oxygen levels, or may occur as a cancer-like condition.
    Deep venous thrombosis (DVT): A blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg. DVTs are dangerous because they may become dislodged and travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism (PE).
    Myocardial infarction (MI): Commonly called a heart attack, a myocardial infarction occurs when a sudden blood clot develops in one of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart.</p>

<h1>
    Additional Information: 
</h1>
<p> The National Blood Authority has asked Lifeblood to put the cost on each bag of blood to make people aware that it does cost money to provide blood to hospitals. Patients are not charged for the blood in public hospitals or private hospitals, and there are no plans to change this
    Does the Australian Red Cross sell blood?
The Australian Red Cross facility houses plastic packets and glass vials of blood, plasma and platelets donated by people across the country. These donations come a long way to get to the plant and have to go through a lot more before they can end up saving lives.
What's the rarest blood type?
Image result
AB negative
What's the rarest blood type? AB negative is the rarest of the eight main blood types - just 1% of our donors have it. Despite being rare, demand for AB negative blood is low and we don't struggle to find donors with AB negative blood. However, some blood types are both rare and in demand
